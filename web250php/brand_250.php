			<h2>Lufkin's Linens&nbsp;&#8466;&#8466;&nbsp;</h2>
			<p>Lufkin's Linens will be a website designed to showcase my artwork and designs,
				as a freelance Textile Designer. This site will demonstrate the skills I have developed while
				I was in school and have continued to develop over the years. We will offer wallpaper, card stock, linens, fabric by the yard
				and quilting samplier packs.  We also offer a free design service to help you design your custom products or you will be
				able to select from our designs and customize the color and scale.  
			</p>
			<p style="text-align:center;"> Here at Lufkin Linen's we are here to help you to make your home one of a kind and special, just like you.</p>
